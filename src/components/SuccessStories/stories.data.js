      "WTM Buea gave me the first opportunity to lead a women’s empowerment group. The most valuable gift was the leadership team at the time and the amazing transition we have experienced ever since. Special thanks to Nkweteyim Daisy, Sandra Emma Nsiany, Ngong Ivan, Ringnyu Melvis, Lum-neh Angela, Amah Praises, Tonia Nkeangyi, and Ngong Ivoline for being the best pioneer leadership team that WTM could ever ask for. WTM continues to inspire and reminds me that there is no limit to what committed people can achieve. To every past and current lead or ambassador, including Shafack Amanda, Tambe Tabitha, Jenniline Ebai, Tiku Gaelle, and countless others, you are the reason we celebrate today. Every block you laid, message you sent, event you organized, and presentation you made led to this day. You are an integral part and the reason for everything I see as success in WTM today and every day",
